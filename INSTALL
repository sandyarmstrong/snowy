Running Snowy From Your Git Checkout
--
-1. Verify that your checkout is called "snowy" (all lower-case).

0. Install python-libxslt, python-libxml2, python-pytz, and python-sqlite,
   python-dateutil, python-pkg-resources, python-uuid, python-json,
   python-openid
   (package names somewhat different from distro to distro).

1. Install django 1.1. If your distro does not have packages for 1.1, then
   download the tarball and install it like so:
	wget http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.1/tarball/
	tar zxvf Django-1.1.tar.gz
	cd Django-1.1
	sudo python setup.py install

2. Set up your local settings file (in your snowy git checkout):
	cp local_settings.py.in local_settings.py

3. Setup snowy database (in your snowy git checkout):
	python manage.py syncdb

	NOTE: Don't name your admin user 'admin'

4. Start mail debugging server (in your snowy git checkout):
	python manage.py debugmail

	NOTE: This is only needed if Snowy needs to send mails (like in the
	case of user registration) and you don't have an SMTP server set up.

5. Start local snowy (in your snowy git checkout):
	python manage.py runserver

6. Admin your snowy:
	http://localhost:8000/admin

	- In the Sites table, make sure to set the domain and name properly, e.g.:

		Domain name:  localhost:8000
		Display name: Snowy

	- In the Consumers table, make sure the 'anyone' consumer is set up:

	        Key: anyone
		Secret: anyone
		Status: Accepted

7. Play with snowy:
	http://localhost:8000/myusername/notes (for example)
